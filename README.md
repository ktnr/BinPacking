# Exact solutions to two-dimensional bin packing problems

This is a partial replication of [Côté, Haouari, Iori (2019): A Primal Decomposition Algorithm for the Two-dimensional Bin Packing Problem. arXiv:1909.06835 [math.OC]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.06835) resp. [Côté, Haouari, Iori (2021): Combinatorial Benders Decomposition for the Two-Dimensional Bin Packing Problem. INFORMS Journal on Computing.](https://doi.org/10.1287/ijoc.2020.1014). 

In contrast to the original paper, this implementation uses Constraint Programming to solve subproblems and generate initial solutions. Not all preprocessing routines and lower bounding procedures are implemented.

## Algorithmic outline

The two-dimensional bin packing problem (2D-BPP) is decomposed into a master problem and several subproblems. The master problem is a (one-dimensional) BPP, which assigns items to bins. Feasibility of each bin assignment is then checked in a separate two-dimensional knapsack subproblem.

The master problem is modeled as a mixed-integer programm (MIP) and solved using [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/). Callbacks are set at integer nodes, where the subproblems are generated and solved by constraint programming (CP) using [google or-tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization/cp/cp_solver). When an infeasible subproblem is found, a cut of the form

is added to exclude the infeasible assignment of items <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=j \in \mathcal{C}"> to bins <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=i \in \mathcal{B}">.

- Start solutions are generated by a 2D-BPP CP model; a simpler version of this model can be found [here]()
- Preprocessing routines include: filtering of large items, determining incompatible items, fixing and restricting item assignment through a conflict graph based on item incompatility
- Improvements to the decomposition approach include: cut strengthening by finding reduced infeasible sets (decrease lhs and rhs of infeasibility cuts), cut lifting by finding valid item displacements for infeasible sets (increasing lhs while keeping rhs constant)
